## To run on a Mac

You may receive security notices when you try to run the executable. This is due
to the fact we don't sign the executable (yet). The message looks like this:

To fix this, click on "Cancel" and then navigate to your security settings 
(system settings --> security). The following screenshot shows the screen:

Click on "Allow Anyway" to allow the `x-ip` tool to work. After that, execute
`x-ip` again. You will see this message this time:

Click on "Open" to allow the execution!
